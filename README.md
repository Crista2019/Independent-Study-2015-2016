# Independent-Study-2015-2016
The computer science independent study completed during my freshman year at Lake City High School, concerning "Electronics: Principles and Electronics."
Used Arduino Developer Board and basic electrical components to test laws of electricity and electronic principles
Programming was done in C++ and used the Processing IDE
Concepts covered included: 
  Reading and writing schematics
  Behavior of: conductors, semiconductors, and insulators, other electrical circuit elements
  Defining/understanding: current types, analog vs. digital, resistance, potential, potential difference, electric field vs. magnetic field, electromagnetism, electromagnetic induction
  Laws/Principles such as: Ohmâ€™s law, electromagnetic induction laws, resistor color codification
